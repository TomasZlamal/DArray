# Dynamic array implementation in c++
## Brief explanation 🗨
This is a simple implementation of the dynamic array data structure in c++.
It is designed to be easy to expand upon and to be well documented.
## Motivation ❓
The reason that I decided to create this library was to have a codebase to look back to
if I ever needed a dynamic array implementation. I published it to github incase other
people had the same need.
